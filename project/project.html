Why I Want to Learn About Python?
</h3>

<p>
    Second things Second, we got python As someone who has always been interested in technology and video games, 
    I've decided to start a journey to learn more about Python programming language.
    Python is a popular programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis to machine learning to some simple games, 
    so i wanted to learn it. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
    Python is an open-source language, which means that it is free to use and can be modified by anyone.
    Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it easy for beginners to learn and use.
    Python has a large standard library, which provides developers with access to a wide range of pre-built modules and functions that can be used to simplify programming tasks.
    Python is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

<h4 style="font-size: 23px;"> learning Multimedia was  challenging </h4>

<p>Last but not Least let's talk about Steganography in multimedia can be challenging because different media types, like images or audio files, require unique skills and techniques to learn that's why i thought it's hard. I can't fully understand it until now.
    Steganography also requires knowledge of how to embed and extract hidden messages, and there are different methods that can be used. It can be difficult to use this technique effectively, especially when it comes to protecting sensitive information.
    However, steganography in multimedia can be an effective way to keep information secure or communicate secretly if used properly.
    Despite the benefits of steganography it can be used in harmful ways if used.
